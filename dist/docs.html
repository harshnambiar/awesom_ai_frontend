        <h1>Info Queries</h1>
        <p>To make information queries free for the Somnia community, Awesom AI maintains a huge reservoir of pre-fabricated queries to get you introduced to Somnia and its ecosystem. These queries must be prefixed with an 'i:', for example, 'i:what is somnia?'. These are directly processed by Awesom AI's backend without making additional third party calls and are 100% free. Here are some of the info queries you can use:</p>
        <p>• what is somnia?<br/>
        • what is the somnia network?<br/>
        • how can i get started on somnia?<br/>
        • what are some cool projects on somnia?<br/>
        • what are some good ___ projects on somnia? (replace ___ with defi, nft, infrastructure, etc)<br/>
        • what are the network details for somnia?<br/>
        • how can i get started on somnia?<br/>
        • tell me about the somnia grants program.<br/>
        • what is the latest news about somnia.<br/>
        Please note that the queries are case insensitive and must be preceded by 'i:'.</p>

        <h1>Transaction Queries</h1>
        <p>To enable the users to be able to complete transactions on the Somnia Network without much hassle, Awesom AI offers many transaction queries that can be used in the chat interface. Here are some of the transaction queries you can use:</p>
        <p>• swap ___ tokens for ___. (where ___ represents the token codes for the token being swapped and obtained. Please note that these must be existing tokens on the Somnia Chain only.)</p>
        <p>• send ___ token to ____. (where ___ represents token amount and code followed by the receiver address)</p>
        <p>• send ___ NFT to ____. (where ____ represents the NFT id and the other is the receiver address)</p>
        <p>• stake ____ tokens. (where ___ is the number of STT tokens to stake)</p>
        <p>Please note that the queries are case insensitive and must be preceded by 'tx:'. Also, they will prompt you to sign-up the transaction with your wallet. The query will fail if you are not logged in with your Metamask.</p>

        <h1>Custom Queries</h1>
        <p>To enable the users to ask something beyond these, Awesom AI has custom queries. These must be preceded by a "keyval:", where the keyval is a secret key (usually 12 character long) which can be obtained after successfully applying for the <a href="https://form.jotform.com/252172180330041" target="_blank">Beta Program</a>.</p>
